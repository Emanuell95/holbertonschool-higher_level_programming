In this project of Python I am working with the different kind of objects in this language. I solidify my understanding in concepts like if an object is mutable or not, how can I copy or cloning. Also I do have the oppotunity to  review if this type of data is the same or not to the other even if they have the same value but their behaviour is different based on his type and what space they occupy in the memory for example.
